####  C - Dynamic libraries

### [0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life](main.h)

Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

- `int _putchar(char c);`
- `int _islower(int c);`
- `int _isalpha(int c);`
- `int _abs(int n);`
- `int _isupper(int c);`
- `int _isdigit(int c);`
- `int _strlen(char *s);`
- `void _puts(char *s);`
- `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`
- `int _atoi(char *s);`
- `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);`
- `char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);`
- `char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);`
- `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
- `char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);`
- `char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);`
- `char *_strchr(char *s, char c);`
- `unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);`
- `char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);`
- `char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);`

### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](1-create_dynamic_lib.sh)

Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

### [2. Let's call C functions from Python](100-operations.so)

Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python.

### [3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!](101-make_me_win.sh)

- You canâ€™t modify the program `gm` itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it
- The system is an `Linux Ubuntu 16.04`
- The server has internet access
- Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS
- Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use `;, &&, ||, |,` (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands- Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script
- Our mole will run your shell script this way: `mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh`
- Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program `gm`, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs `gm` with my numbers: `./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9`
- MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole
- Before running the `gm` program, MSS always check the content of the directory
- MSS always exit after running the program `gm`
